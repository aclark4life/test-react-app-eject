    Success! Created test-react-app-eject at /Users/alexclark/Developer/test-react-app-eject
    Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

      npm start
        Starts the development server.

      npm run build
        Bundles the app into static files for production.

      npm test
        Starts the test runner.

      npm run eject
        Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
        and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

    We suggest that you begin by typing:

      cd /Users/alexclark/Developer/test-react-app-eject
      npm start

    Happy hacking!
